[LeetCode: 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/description/)

### 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
### 题目描述
Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]

Output: 5

Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.


Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.

Example 2:

Input: [7,6,4,3,1]

Output: 0

Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

抽象出来就是求一个数组中从后向前差值最大的值

首先，暴力做法最容易想到
```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        
        int len = prices.length;
        int max = 0;
        
        if (len == 0) return 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
                int diff = prices[j] - prices[i];
                if (diff >  max) {
                    max = diff;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```

但回头看，其实不需要双重循环，因为遍历时遇到比自己前面小的元素时，可以记录下来，然后跳过，不需要比较。

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        
        int len = prices.length;
        
        if (len == 0) return 0;
        
        int max = 0;
        int min = prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < len; i++) {
            if (prices[i] < min) min = prices[i];
            else max = max > (prices[i] - min) ? max : (prices[i] - min);
        }
        
        return max;
    }
}
```
